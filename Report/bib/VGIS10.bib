abstract = {This paper presents a method for tracking multiple objects from a given video dataset. We can track many objects at a time efficiently using Kalman Filter and Optical flow algorithm. Here in this paper, we propose improved optical flow algorithm which works with high accuracy and overcomes occlusion in a video. So, improved optical flow algorithm is found to be more promising as it gives better accuracy in less computation.},
