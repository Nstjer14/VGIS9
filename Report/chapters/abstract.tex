As computational power of mobile phones increases together with the capabilities of the built in camera new security measures are introduced to the consumer. These consist of biometric modalities such as iris and face recognition separately. This project seeks to find a viable solution to combining the two modalities. By designing two networks, one for iris recognition and one for face recognition a fusion solution of the two networks are sought out. The iris recognition \gls{cnn} manages to reach a accuracy of $99.7\%$ and the face recognition $99.35\%$ individually. The fusion of the two networks reaches an accuracy of $81.17\%$. This is achieved when trained on a chimeric database made by merging the two databases used for the individual \gls{cnn}s. When using the individual traits from the combined dataset for the individual networks their accuracies lowered below the fusion net. Therefore, there is supposedly a flaw in the composition of the chimeric database, however, the fusion network outperforms the individual networks when trained on the same data.
