Several warehouses around the world are starting to use robots for picking groceries of different sorts \citep{Olsen2018, Perez2018, Vincent2018}. This is done to automate the process of grocery picking and make the entire process faster, to be able to deliver packages faster. \cite{Olsen2018, Perez2018, Vincent2018} present robots picking from boxes and not free standing products like in a general supermarket.\\

The goal of Aivero is to enable robots in a general supermarket set-up to pick groceries straight from the shelves with only the information of which section the desired grocery is. The aim is do this using a video stream directly from the robot and process this data in real time. Using the video stream a processing unit must identify the desired grocery and find the optimal picking point on the grocery. For a potential higher accuracy the goal is to use both a regular colour video stream, RGB, and depth video. This will enable the robot to see the groceries in physical shape better from the depth video, but also use th RGB video stream to recognise e.g. labels on a product.
